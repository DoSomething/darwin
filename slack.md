* Fill out your 🔐[profile](https://dosomething.slack.com/account/profile)

## Tips, Tricks & Etiquette

**Use 🔐**[**\#announce**](https://dosomething.slack.com/archives/announce) **for important company announcements.**  
This should only be for general DS company wide announcements.

**Use 🔐\#announce-tech for important product/engineering/data-related announcements.**  
This should be used for any technical announcements to the product, engineering, and/or data teams.

**Use 🔐\#announce-office for NYC office-related chatter.**  
This can be used for office related chatter like notifying folks that there's food in the kitchen.

**Use public rooms!**  
We work in a collaborative environment, and we should keep the history so it's searchable forever!

**Feel free join and leave channels.**  
👋 You can `/mute` 🔕 channels \(so you only receive messages when your name or `@channel` is mentioned\) or leave channels if they become overwhelming.

**Set up custom alerts**  
🔔 You can [watch for your name, or certain phrases](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201398467-Highlight-word-notifications) so you'll always be notified when there are "cookies" in the office.

**Have some down time**  
You can set yourself to `/away` if you need heads-down time.

**Search for answers**  
Slack has a very [powerful search feature](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202528808-Searching-in-Slack), and since we use public channels you can search for things easily!

### Alerting others

Only use the following commands if everyone needs to know something urgent \(for example there is food in the kitchen, or we are filming in the office\)

* `@here` will send a desktop/mobile notification to everyone who is currently active in that channel
* `@channel` will send a desktop/mobile notification to EVERYONE in the channel
* `@alert` will alert tech people if you see something wrong with the dosomething.org website—do this in the `#devops` room

### Emoji

After 3 months at DoSomething we will make an emoji of your face. We use emoji reactions to send follow up messages. Here are our most frequent:

* 🎉 - `:tada:` congrats, hooooray, happy birthday
* 👍 - `:thumbsup:` got it
* ✅ - `:check:` I did that 
* ➕ - `:plus:` I agree
* 🙇 - `:bow:` thanks!
* 🐧 - `:penguin:` A stuffed animal given at the end of staff meeting from the reigning holder to another staff member who did a baller job that week.

## Bots

* 🔐[Slackbot](https://dosomething.slack.com/customize/slackbot): Just a pal that Slack gives us for free, we can customize to respond to certain phrases 
* 🔐[George](https://github.com/DoSomething/hubot-george): Custom bot that we use to deploy code, and displays silly messages if you say "dance"
