# Darwin
Filled with feelings, notes and next steps from retro


### Goal 
Every fortnight we have a retro meeting where we talk about the previous two weeks; what we built, what worked, what didn't. During that meeting there is often next steps of things we can do better. This is a semi-public forum to open issues against any next steps that come out of the meetings.

### Format
We can play around with the format here and try to figure out the way that best works for us. 
Currently our notes live [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nKWjgXOelPd4MPVxRnBZcDJtqPyG9B8iVWFE2E-wKMo)
Do we want to move that into markdown files in this repo? Who's to say?
