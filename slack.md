## Tips, Tricks & Etiquette 
**Use 🔐[#srsly-read-this](https://dosomething.slack.com/archives/srsly-read-this) seriously** This should only be for general DS company wide announcements. Things like, food in the kitchen, a new campaign we are launching *(not things like I need a cat sitter, or does anyone have advil)*
 
**Use public rooms!**  We work in a collabroative environment, and we should keep the history so it's searchable forever!

**Feel free join and leave channels.** 👋 You can `/mute` 🔕 channels (so you only receive messages when your name or @channel is mentioned) or leave channels if they become overwhelming.

**Set up custom alerts** 🔔 you can [watch for your name, or certain phrases](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201398467-Highlight-word-notifications) so you'll always be notified when there are "cookies" in the office. 

### Alerting others
only use the following commands if everyone needs to know something urgent (for example there is food in the kitchen, or we are filming in the office) 
- `@here` will send a desktop/mobile notification to everyone who is currently active in that channel
- `@channel` will send a desktop/mobile notification to EVERYONE in the channel
- `@alert` will alert tech people if you see something wrong with the dosomething.org website, do this in the #devops room

## Bots

- 🔐[George](https://github.com/DoSomething/hubot-george) - custom bot, that we use to deploy code, and displays silly messages if you say "dance"
