## Senior Software Engineer (SSE)

_Not every single one of these criteria needs to be satisfied to be considered a full JSE. But the role comprises, in some combination or other, the majority of these._

Grading scale for each section uses the following:

- Needs Opportunity
- Needs Significant Work
- Basic
- Good
- Great
- Expert

### Technical Skill/Knowledge
- Understands the broad architecture of the entire system
- Knowledge of best practices: coding standards, architecture, testing, validation, data recovery
- Mastered several technologies which allows for evaluation/selection from new and known approaches to successfully implement projects of moderate complexity
- Designs and implements subsystems of the software architecture that can scale and be reliable with minimal technical oversight 
- Understands/Can setup, manage and monitor application and infrastructure/build (i.e., deployment pipeline, logging, application monitoring and alerts, rollbacks, code quality checks)
- Handles product releases
- Makes significant contributions to our test coverage
- Effective at debugging
- Demonstrated ability to integrate with external APIs
- Comfortable with database tuning & administration
- Understands and is able to setup automated functional, load/performance, and integration tests
- Familiarity with and contributes to caching strategy
- Able to effectively QB at least one area of the codebase
- Familar/Comfortable with more than one area of the codebase

### Impact
- Scopes and stages work into well-defined milestones to avoid a monolithic deliverable
- Regularly delivers software on-time and is constantly working to make accurate estimates and deliver on those estimates
- Contributes to a framework or development practice. Has enough experience here to have a point of view, and can argue for systemic improvements
- Possesses empathy with the user of the software they are producing and uses that empathy to guide decision-making  
- Identifies and proactively tackles technical debt before it grows into debt that requires significant up-front work to resolve
- Provides technical advice and weighs in on technical decisions that impact other teams or the company at large
- Takes initiative to identify and solve important problems, coordinating with others on cross-cutting technical issues
- Understands how their work fits in to the larger project, and understands and frequently reflects on the business goals
- Consistently writes code that sets the standard for quality and maintainability
- Handles open-ended problems & ambiguity well

### Communication
- Clearly communicates timeline, scope and technical concerns
- Makes others better through code reviews, documentation, technical guidance, and mentoring or serving as a Tech Lead (technical or team lead) on a project.
- Regular consults with other developers on architecture, best practices, and documentation
- Proactively identifies problems with requirements (lack of clarity, inconsistencies, technical limitations) for their own and adjacent work, and communicates these issues early to help course-correct

### Leadership
- Has a mentor relationship with other engineers. This is broadly defined as serving as an effective listener, giving constructive critism often, and acting as a champion for others in order to facilitate growth. Knowledge sharing happens often via pairing, design review, code reviews, and presentations.
- Comfortable doing R&D in new technologies & techniques
- Influences how we work and what we work on
- Solicits feedback from others and is eager to find ways to improve
- Understands the tradeoffs between technical, analytical and product needs and leads to solutions that take all of these needs into account
- Serve as proactive and efficient conduit for knowledge sharing across Product & Engineering
- Self-aware of strengths and weaknesses
- Intentional about career and growth
- Builds consensus for decisions

- Sets direction at the project/service level and consistently influences decision-making for the project/team
- Delegates effectively; ensures tasks are completed as specified without micromanaging
- Continues to contribute bug fixes and small features without becoming a bottleneck for the project/team

##### Team
- Focused on and responsible for the team's productivity and collective impact

### Communication
##### Technical & Team
