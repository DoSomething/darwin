## Tips, Tricks & Etiquette 
**Use 🔐[#srsly-read-this](https://dosomething.slack.com/archives/srsly-read-this) seriously** This should only be for general DS company wide announcements. Things like, food in the kitchen, a new campaign we are launching *(not things like I need a cat sitter, or does anyone have advil)*
 
**Use public rooms!**  We work in a collabroative environment, and we should keep the history so it's searchable forever!

**Feel free join and leave channels.** 👋 You can `/mute` 🔕 channels (so you only receive messages when your name or @channel is mentioned) or leave channels if they become overwhelming.

**Set up custom alerts** 🔔 you can [watch for your name, or certain phrases](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201398467-Highlight-word-notifications) so you'll always be notified when there are "cookies" in the office. 

**Have some down time** you can set yourself to `/away` if you need heads-down time

**Search for answers** slack has a very [powerful search feature](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202528808-Searching-in-Slack), and since we use public channels you can search for things easily!

### Alerting others
only use the following commands if everyone needs to know something urgent (for example there is food in the kitchen, or we are filming in the office) 
- `@here` will send a desktop/mobile notification to everyone who is currently active in that channel
- `@channel` will send a desktop/mobile notification to EVERYONE in the channel
- `@alert` will alert tech people if you see something wrong with the dosomething.org website, do this in the #devops room

### Emoji 
After 3 months at DoSomething we will make an emoji of your face
We use emoji reactions to send follow up messages. Here's our most frequent 
- 🎉 - `:tada:` congrats, hooooray, happy birthday
- 👍 - `:thumbsup:` got it
- ✅ - `:check:` I did that 
- ➕ - `:plus:` I agree
- 🙇 - `:bow:` thanks!
- 🐧 - `:penguin` A stuffed animal given at the end of staff meeting from the reigning holder to another staff member who did a baller job that week.

## Bots 
- 🔐[Slackbot](https://dosomething.slack.com/customize/slackbot) - just a pal that slack gives us for free, we can customize to respond to certain phrases 
- 🔐[George](https://github.com/DoSomething/hubot-george) - custom bot, that we use to deploy code, and displays silly messages if you say "dance"
